This is my personal ebuild gentoo overlay repository.
I publish packaged software that I've written to be used on the Gentoo GNU/Linux distribution.
There are also some programs here that I haven't written.
Source tarballs are are checked for integrity with Manifest files.

My programs:
	program	ebuild package	project homepage
	---
	sear.c	www-apps/searc	http://ni.sijanec.eu/sijanec/sear.c

Installing packages: emerge --ask www-apps/searc
